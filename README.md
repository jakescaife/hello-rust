# Hello Rust!

In 2020, Rust has been voted the 'most loved' programming language in the StackOverflow developer
survey each year since 2016. After writing a bunch of C, C++ and Python I figured it might be time
to try something new. Rust boasts performance similar to C and C++ but with advantages in
productivity and correctness. A modern toolchain and expressive language with the performance
of C sounds like it could be a lot of fun!
